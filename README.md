# PHP CLI Examples

This repository contains several sample PHP CLI scripts to accompany my talk, [_Building for the PHP Command Line Interface_](https://github.com/stevegrunwell/building-for-php-cli).

Within the `src/` directory, you'll find sub-directories covering the following topics:

* [Argument handling](src/Args)
* [Environment variables](src/EnvVars)
* [Exit codes](src/ExitCodes)
* [System commands](src/SystemCommands)

There are also demonstrations of the tools discussed:

* [Symfony Console](src/SymfonyConsole)
* [PHP-CLI Tools](src/PhpCliTools)
* [CLImate](src/CLImate)

## Installation

To install these samples locally, please start by installing their dependencies via [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/):

```sh
composer install
```
